<h1> Netflix Viewership Project </h1>
<p> I think that there's a lot more available in our public disclosures than we think there are. To investigate this idea, I wanted to take a relatively limited dataset and pull as much information as possible out of it.</p>
<p> I chose the Netflix Quarterly Viewership reports. There have been many complaints about transparency in Netflix's content, and in response to those complaints, Netflix started releasing quarterly reports detailing how many views each season recieved over that quarter. Let's see what we can learn about viewership habits from these reports.</p>

<p> The Quarterly Viewership reports are not collected anywhere, but this analysis includes the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-first-half-of-2024">January 2024 - June 2024</a></li>
</ul>

<p> A couple of guiding questions: </p>
<ul>
    <li>What data can we pull from these few columns</li>
    <li>Can we predict lifetime viewership for a particular TV program based on the first few months of performance?</li>
    <li>How do friends/Suits buck the normal trend for shows?</li>
</ul>
